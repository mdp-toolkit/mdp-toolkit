"""
Special BiNode class derived from Node to allow complicated flow patterns.

Messages:
=========

The message argument 'msg' of the outer method 'execute' or 'train' is either a
dict or None (which is treated equivalently to an empty dict and is the default
value). The message is automatically parsed against the method signature of
_train or _execute (or any other specified method) in the following way:

    normal key string -- Is copied if in signature and passed as a named
        argument.

    node_id->key -- Is extracted (i.e. removed in original message) and passed
        as a named argument. The separator '->' is also stored available
        as the constant MSG_ID_SEP. If the key is not an argument of the
        message then the whole key is simply erased.

The msg returned from the inner part of the method (e.g. _execute) is then used
to update the original message (so values can be overwritten).

If args without default value are missing in the message, this will result in
the standard Python missing-arguments-exception (this is not checked by BiNode
itself).


BiNode Return Value Options:
============================

 result for execute:
     x, (x, msg), (x, msg, target)

 result for train:
    None -- terminates training
    x, (x, msg), (x, msg, target) -- Execution is continued and
        this node will be reached at a later time to terminate training.
        If the result has the form (None, msg) then the msg is dropped (so
        it is not required to 'clear' the message manually).

 result for stop_training:
    None -- Simply terminates the training, like for a normal node.
    x, (x, msg), (x, msg, target) -- Causes an execute like phase, which
        terminates when the end of the flow is reached or when EXIT_TARGET
        is given as target value (just like during a normal execute phase).


Magic message keys:
===================

When the incoming message is parsed by the BiNode base class, some argument
keywords are treated in a special way:

 'msg' -- If any method like _execute accept a 'msg' keyword then the complete
     remaining message (after parsing the other keywords) is supplied. The
     message in the return value then completely replaces the original message
     (instead of only updating it). This way a node can completely control the
     message and for example remove keys.

 'target' -- If any template method like execute finds a 'target' keyword in
     the message then this is used as the target value in the return value.
     However, if _execute then also returns a target value this overwrites the
     target value.

  'method' -- Specify the name of the method that should be used instead of
      the standard one (e.g. in execute the standard method is _execute).
      An underscore is automatically added in front, so to select _execute
      one would have to provide 'execute'.
      If 'inverse' is given then the inverse dimension check will be performed
      and if no target is provided it will be set to -1.

    as a BiNode method for continuations (which is more elegant and convenient
    than using a a state machine implementation). 

    args -- List of string names of the additional arguments. Note that the
        standard 'x' array is always given as the first value. So if n args
        are requested the yield will return n+1 values.
    defaults -- Tuple of default values for the arguments. If this tuple has
        n elements, they correspond to the last n elements in 'args'
        (following the convention of inspect.getfullargspec).

    Internally there are three methods/functions:
        - The user defined function containing the original coroutine code.
          This is only stored in the decorator closure.
        - A new method ('_coroutine_initialization') with the name and
          signature  of the decorated coroutine, which internally handles the
          first initialization of the coroutine instance.
          This method is returned by the decorator.
        - A method with the signature specified by the 'args' for the
          decorator.
          After the coroutine has been initialized this
          method shadows the initialization method in the class instance
          (using an instance attribute to shadow the class attribute).
