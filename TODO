What follows is an old TODO. Nothing of what you read here is going to ever be implemented,
unless some new developer shows up. We keep the TODO here just for historical reasons and
for everlasting shame on us ;)

for MDP 3.3
===========

- clearify documentation on Flow.train as suggested by Fabian Schoenfeld in
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27926167
- checkout windows 64bit binaries from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ maybe point to it from the documentation?
- add code for generating the plots in the tutorial (but we don't want the
  doctests to fail if matplotlib is not installed: find a good way of
  dealing with it, pymvpa already does it properly)
- document extension disable environment variables
- docstrings should be migrated to rst everywhere (only class.__doc__ has
  been done for now)
- example pages are still not good enough:
  idea: I actually think that every example page should be
  self-consistent, so no imports (apart from system-installed modules
  of course) should be allowed. if an example requires a lot of
  boiler-plate code, this code could be attached at the end of the
  example page. note that you can use the literalinclude [1]
  directive to include the code, so you don't even need to re-type
  everything in rst. this solution has the big advantage of allowing
  doctest to run properly and to avoid magic tricks with sys.path,
  which are not exactly elegant and prone to fail 
  [1] http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/code.html?highlight=include#literalinclude
- remove _monkeypatch_pp when parallel python is fixed
- let EtaConmputerNode match the new convention of SFA Node in terms of
  last sample.
- add example of usage of MDP within PyMVPA. The code exists already:
  https://github.com/PyMVPA/PyMVPA/blob/master/doc/examples/mdp_mnist.py
- find a solution to the __revision__ problem: should it be set on installation?
   numpy solved the problem, do we want to go this route?
- parallel: provide adapters for more sophisticated schedulers
- add _bias attribute to PCANode to make it more consistent with SFA node.
  Maybe one could even create a new AffineNode node as a base class for PCA,
  SFA and other affine transformations?
  This might also be a good opportunity for some more PEP8 cleanup.
- add more classifier stuff, like a ClassifierFlow
- add an example of training a node with multiple training phases using a flow,
  where the training is done first using lists and then using a custom iterators.
  special care should be taken on explaining how to pass additional arguments to
  the train method. an example of how this can look confusing and go wrong can be 
  found in the testFlowWrongItarableException test in test_flows.py
- fix damned LLENode test for 2D shape embedded in 3D!
- check that SparsePCA works on machine with scipy 0.9.0, add it to MDP if so
- create a Flow metaclass to enable Flow extensions (think of ParallelFlow!)
- implement an extension context manager with additional parameters and 
  exception handling. E.g.:
  flow = Flow([PCANode()])
  with extension('parallel', args=(ProcessScheduler,8)):
      flow.train(x)
  note that the context manager takes care of initialize and shutting down the
  scheduler. Proposed syntax:
  extension(string, args=tuple, kwargs=dictionary)
- bimdp: add deep belief network flow and nodes to the core bimdp
- add cross-correlation tools, maybe support the use of a parallel scheduler
- check problem with LLENode tutorial demo when using matplotlib 
  0.99.1.2, see Olivier Grisel's email
- LinearRegressionNode: add optional 2nd phase that computes residuals
  and significance of the slope
- provide a Node pickler, for arrays use the binary numpy format (npy,
  numpy.save, numpy.load) and not pickle: pickling arrays is unsupported
- add benchmarks for parallel module
- provide different versions of the MDP logo which includes the
  website address, possibly one higher quality print version,
  available in "how to cite" section
- Use the new property decorators when migrating to Python 2.6 (see
  http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#property).
- kalman filters
- memory profiler
- GUI
